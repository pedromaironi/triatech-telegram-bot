Documentation of my [TriaTech](http://telegram.me/Triatechbot) Bot for Telegram.

<!-- # Requirements

### [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)

### [ColorClass](https://github.com/Robpol86/colorclass) -->

# Getting Started

## IMPORTANT

This is outdated. I'll update it as soon as possible. Stay tunned :)

First of all, this bot is running in Python 3 so you need to install it and also pip for installing the modules.

Then, you need the used modules.
```markdown
Tip: Type `pip` and double-tab to see different possibilities, maybe you need to need to use `pip-3.X` or only `pip`.
```

```bash
pip3 install colorclass
pip3 install pyTelegramBotAPI
pip3 install psutil
```
When you have the `API key` and the `Token`, paste them into `extra_data/data.json`.
